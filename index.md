### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

I chose Lab 1 because it was the first-ever lab I did, and it introduced me to the intricate world of coding. I was fascinated by how I could use the programming language to command a computer to give an expected output. Although this lab was very simple and easy, it is a basic activity that everyone should know how to do when first learning a programming language.

* Lab 4

I liked doing lab 4 part 2 because I found the game to be very fun to code. It was very interesting to use else-if statement to code a high-low game. We hade to code all the different outcomes of the game, which was kind of challenging, but fun enough to enjoy.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 was very challenging but very fun at the same time. We had to figure out when you were available to park at certain spots. It was fun coding the parking.cc file, using && and || to figure out if you could park.
