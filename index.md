* Lab 1

I chose Lab 1 because it was the first-ever lab I did, and it introduced me to the intricate world of coding. I was fascinated by how I could use the programming language to command a computer to give an expected output. Although this lab was very simple and easy, it is a basic activity that everyone should know how to do when first learning a programming language.
